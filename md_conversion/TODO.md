### Goal :- This weekend I have to convert headings(h1-h6) into html code

### WHAT I'LL HAVE IN "README.md" FILE is one heading only.

## Things to now:-

- [x] 1. Make the Dir. structure
- [x] 2. Create targetFile, todo.md, conversion.js
- [x] 3. I'll assume I have headings content I'll not read the File .
- [x] 4. I have to read the headings from "README.md" md file .
- [x] 5. I store it .
- [x] 6. Then I have to convert that line into respective tags of html code.
- [x] 7. Now I have to parse the p statement .
- [x] 8. I have to convert it into p tag.
